Task 1: Discussion Task
Explore the code and make notes on the following features and how it is being implemented in the code.

We'd like you to note down what classes and methods are used and how the objects interact.

The features are:

Get all books
Get a book by ID
Add a book
As well as the scala code, it's worth having a look at the routes file as well.

Can you see where the routes for the books are configured? ðŸ¤”

Here is a bit more detail on the play framework HTTP routing


----


The code is structure in the MVC way.
Models
Views
Controllers
in dedicated directories

The routes in conf I found slightly less obvious, but it is a matter of opinion what is code and what is configuration

The framework seems the rely heavily on annotations.
Personally I am not a fan, because I am quick to debug and with annotations that gets more difficult.
For many errors you will need to understand how the framework works before being able to fix stuff, instead of letting the debugger tell you what is happening.
